          <h1>About Instant Domain Search</h1>
          <p>
            I built Instant Domain Search in 2005 after attending <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a>
            â€™s inaugural <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/">Startup School</a> at Harvard. After the day of
            lectures, I was eager to launch a startup. I had a few ideas, but I was frustrated with how slow WHOIS
            queries are--and how hard it is to find a good name.
          </p>

          <p>
            It turns out that VeriSign publishes{' '}
            <a href="https://www.verisign.com/en_US/channel-resources/domain-registry-products/zone-file/index.xhtml">
              a list of domain names
            </a>{' '}
            in a giant zone file every night. Once I faxed the zone access agreement back to VeriSign, they provided me
            with access to the zone file. I got a dedicated server, hacked together a script, and was able to index the
            hundreds of millions of .com domain names with MySQL.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was surprised by how fast even the first version was. Once I had the JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL running
            smoothly, I posted a first version of the site to the Startup School wiki. Soon after, I got an email from
            <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a> inviting me to apply to Y Combinator. Michael Arrington
            noticed the site and covered{' '}

            </a>{' '}
            in November of 2005.
          </p>

          <p>
            I received funding from Y Combinator in 2006 and built an online image editor, Snipshot. I joined{' '}
            <a href="https://www.facebook.com/beau">Facebook</a> as an engineer in 2009 and, after four intense years,
            left in 2013 to work on other projects.
